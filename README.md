Assessing Gene Stability And Gene Affinity In Microarray Data Classification Using An Extended Relieff Algorithm

If you are planning to use this code in your research, please cite this [paper]( Assessing Gene Stability And Gene Affinity In Microarray Data Classification Using An Extended Relieff Algorithm).

## Dataset
Datasets are DNA microarray gene expression data. [Dataset Link]( //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser/.).

## Methods
We are using Extended ReliefF and Traditional ReliefF methods for Feature Selection and SVM, RF and MLP for classification.

## Download

```
git clone https://github.com/Neha012329/extended-ReliefF
```

## Usage
*data* folder should be filled with the dataset you want to classify.
```
